# Introduction

**Visualisations** have the power to paint a *vivid* picture. The aim of this dashboard is to paint a picture of the global state of the health of our children. The dashboard will focus on the core areas of 

- low birth weight in new borns,
- life expectancy at birth

offering *valuable* insights into the challenges and successes in child health worldwide. 

![](images.png)

The dashboard begins by analsying the prevalence of low birth weight in ***countries*** in **2005** and **2020** on a ***map visualisation***. It proceeds to analyse the same data in a ***time series analysis***. Next, the relationships between life expectancy and low birth weight are compared using a ***scatterplot***. The final visualisation is a ***bar chart*** displaying average life expectancy at birth per continent. 

This **dashboard** provides a journey of discovery by *uncovering trends*, *identifying disparities*, and *striving to answer pressing questions* about the health and vitality of our children. Analsying the following visualisations provides ***power*** to drive *informed decisions* and *meaningful change* for the future of our youth.


## Maps

```{r}

map_world <- map_data("world")

# Map 2005

data_join %>%
  filter(year == 2005) %>%
  full_join(map_world, by = c("country" = "region")) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = obs_value))+
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Low Birth Weight % by Country in 2005",
  fill = "%") + 
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "calibri")
  )

```


The **Map Visualisations** displays the *Percentage* of **Babies Born Underweight** in each country for the years

- 2005
- 2020

Evidently, ***India*** is the country with the lowest birth weight percentage in **2005**, surpassing the other countries by a significant amount. The second map visualisation shows the percentage of babies born underweight in **2020**. While the low-birth-weight rates have only changed slightly over the 15-year period, they appear to have changed *in unison* across the countries, showing a slight decrease globally. 

For example, low birth weight percentages in ***Australia*** have decreased from *6.33%* in **2005** to *6.55%* in 2020. Similarly, the percentage for ***India***, the country most affected, has also decreased from *30.52%* in **2005** to *27.44%* in **2020**. 

However, the decreases are so slight that they are not ***clearly visible*** on the map visualisation. It must also be noted that ***Covid-19*** took place in **2020**, which may have impacted on the figures given normal circumstances.


```{r}

# Map 2020

data_join %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  full_join(map_world, by = c("country" = "region")) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = obs_value))+
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Low Birth Weight % by Country in 2020",
       fill = "%") +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "calibri")
  )

```



## Time Series

```{r}
# time series

install.packages("plotly")

library(plotly)

timeseries_plot_1 <- data_join %>%
  filter(year >= 2000 & year <= 2022) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(year, obs_value, group = country, color = continent) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Low Birth Weight %",
       title = "Low Birth Weight % per Continent") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Calibri")) 

ggplotly(timeseries_plot_1) %>%
  layout(plot_bgcolor = "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
         paper_bgcolor = "rgba(0,0,0,0)")

```


The above visualisation is presenting the *same data*, ***prevalence of low birth rate per country***, but in a **Time Series** format. This allows a *clearer trend* in the data to be established. By *hovering* over the lines in the time series, the 

- Country, 
- Continent,
- Low birth weight percentage (labelled 'Obs_value') and
- The relevant year 

is displayed. 

<img src="lowbirthweight.jpg" alt="lowbirthweight" width="300" height="200">


By separating the data by **continent**, a more meaningful picture can be painted with the data. It is clear from the visualisation that **Asia** and **Africa** experience the *highest percentages* of low birth weight, with **India** once again clearly presenting as the most impacted country overall. 

**Europe** and the **Americas** experience a *lower prevalence* of babies being born underweight, while **Oceania** lies somewhere in the *middle*. It is also clear that there is ***less data*** presented for **Oceania**. This is because this data is *absent* from the *data source*. The inclusion of the missing data may provide a more *well-rounded* picture of the prevalence of underweight babies in Oceania and allow for a more *accurate* comparison with the other continents.


## Scatterplot

```{r}

# scatter plot

scatter_plot <- ggplot(data_join) +
  aes(obs_value, Life_exp_at_birth, color = continent, size = obs_value) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Low Birth Weight %",
       y = "Life Expectancy at Birth",
       title = "Relationship between Low Birth Weight and Life Expectancy at Birth", color = "continent") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Calibri"))

hover_info <- paste("Country: ", data_join$country, "<br>",
                    "Observation Value: ", data_join$obs_value, "<br>",
                    "Life Expectancy at Birth: ", data_join$Life_exp_at_birth)

ggplotly(scatter_plot)
```


The above **Scatterplot** displays key trends linking the *prevalence* of ***Low Birth Weight*** to **Life expectancy at birth** overtime. The *trend* of this visualisation suggests that *continents* with a higher life expectancy at birth tend to have a lower percentage of babies born underweight. It also suggests that as life expectancy at birth **decreases**, the *low-birth-weight* percentage for that country **increases**. By hovering across the *data points* on the scatter plot the following information is displayed for each data point:

- Life Expectancy at Birth,
- Low Birth Weight % (labelled 'Obs_value'), and 
- Continent.


## Bar Chart

```{r}

# Bar chart

data_join %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(m_life_exp_at_birth = mean(Life_exp_at_birth, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year == 2008) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(continent, m_life_exp_at_birth, fill = continent) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Life Expectancy at Birth",
       y = "Continent",
       title = "Average Life Expectancy at Birth per Continent in 2008") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "cailibri"), 
    axis.text.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("green", "red", "blue", "yellow","purple","grey"))

```


The above **Bar Chart** displays the ***average life expectancy at birth*** per ***continent*** in **2008** While there is a *null* bar due to *gaps in the data*, clear ***trends*** can be established between the various ***continents*** displayed. The continents ranked from *highest* to *lowest* in terms of life expectancy at birth is as follows:

1. Eurpoe
2. The Americas
3. Asia
4. Oceania
5. Africa

As a clear *ranking* can be established between the **continents**, work can be done to ensure **countries** in ***Africa*** receive the *resources* and *facilities* they need to combat the **low** life expectancy they are experiencing.  


# Conclusion

Through the *lens* of *data*, we've gained ***valuable insights*** into the challenges faced by young populations *worldwide*, from **low birth weight** to access to vital treatments for common childhood illnesses. 

The dashboard presented many findings, *for example*, 

- **Africa** is the continent that suffers the most from low birth weight in new borns, 
- **India** is being the single most impacted country. 

*Average* life expectancy can be correlated with both low birth weight to provide *interesting insights*. By examining more closely ***individual continents***, more specific trends could be examined. However, this posed difficulties due to **gaps in the data** causing a *lack of consistency* in the findings. Most importantly, the dashboard allowed for the critical importance of ***investing in the well-being of our children*** to be uncovered. Going forward, this knowledge can be used to drive *positive change*, ensuring every child has the opportunity to *thrive* and reach their *full potential*.
